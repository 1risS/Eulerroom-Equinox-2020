      <p>March Equinox (3:50am Fri 20th March, and surrounding days)</p>
      <h2>CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS AND EVENTS</h2>
      <p>An equinox is a day when the whole world gets 12 hours of sunlight. The March equinox marks the beginning of autumn in the southern hemisphere and spring in the northern hemisphere.</p>
      <p>For March Equinox 2020 we will celebrate sixteen years of the TOPLAP live coding community with a nonstop online stream, over 20th-22nd March.</p>
      <p>If you want to contribute to the stream, you can do that either as an individual from your home/studio/workplace/local cafe etc, or from an organised event.</p>
      <h3>This is an open call for:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Local Events - want to organise an algorave, symposium, live art action, roundtable discussion or something else in your locality? Want to stream it to the worldwide live coding community? First deadline: 22nd December 2019. Fill this form to express your interest </li>
        <li>Streamed Events - Or perhaps an online event, using collaborative software? Fill this form </li>
        <li>Talks/demos - want to show something old or new, relating to live coding? You can speak in whatever language you prefer. Fill this form <li>
        <li>Performances - want to share your live coding with the world? Contributions from people new to the scene are welcome. Fill this form </li>
        <li>Reviewers - lets form a diverse team of people giving constructive comments on submissions! Fill this form </li>
        <li>Volunteers - want to help out? For example with translation of texts (including this call!), transcription / translation of talks, editing of videos, sharing news, and general organising.. We need you to make this happen! Fill this form </li>
      </ul>
      <p>All proposals will be peer reviewed by community members, who may choose to remain anonymous. No proposal will be rejected on the basis of merit. Proposals may be rejected in certain circumstances, for example for being a) against the code of conduct, b) completely unrelated to the field of live coding. On the second point, proposals which stretch the definition of live coding are very welcome.</p>

        <p>Eulerroom Equinox is a volunteer-run initiative without funding, so cannot help with expenses or other costs. Local event organisers are welcome to apply for local funding sources.</p>
