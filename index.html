      <b>Live Coding</b> is an artistic technique by which music or visuals are generated and modified by writing lines 
      of code in different programming languages, giving instructions to the sound or video cards in the computers 
      where the script is ejecuted.
      You can check all the existing languages <a href="https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding" target="blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="lctl">
      <b>TOPLAP</b>  stands for "Temporary Organization for the Proliferation of Live Art Programming" or 
      "Transdimensional Organisation for the Parsimony of Live Art Programming" but if you want 
      further info you better go <a href="https://toplap.org/about/" target="blank">here</a>.

      <p>All proposals will be peer reviewed by community members, who may choose to remain anonymous. No proposal will be rejected on the basis of merit. Proposals may be rejected in certain circumstances, for example for being a) against the code of conduct, b) completely unrelated to the field of live coding. On the second point, proposals which stretch the definition of live coding are very welcome.</p>
